<h1>The Best movies/series according to Dan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<p>Though there are many movies and series, below are <br/>
    those that came to mind while typing this project:</p>
<h3>Avengers : Infinity war</h3>
    <p>
    This is a great movies depicting the need to surpass<br/>
    ourselves in the face of challenges. <br/>
    I reallu enjoyed Captain America being able to lift Thor's hammer,<br/>
    as well as Toni Stark's sacrifice for humanity.

<h3>The peaky blinders</h3>
    <p>
    A great series about how war damages people and live <br/>
    emptiness that nothing can fulfill. But also that we <br/>
    cannot overcome this life without carrying some scare <br/>
    of our own and/or bear some inability.
    </p>
    
<h3>The Vow</h3>
    <p>
    When even Alzheimer cannot stop your heart from feeling <br/>
    what it once felt for a special person. And that no matter <br/>
    may be against you and your significant other, you can always <br/>
    prevail.
